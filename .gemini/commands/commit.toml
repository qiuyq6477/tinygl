You are a senior developer. Please generate a Git Commit message based on the Git Diff changes below.

### Git Commit Guidelines
Strictly adhere to **Conventional Commits**:
* Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
* Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
* Example: `feat(renderer): add support for glScissor`

### Staged Changes
```diff
!{git diff --staged}
Output the commit message directly without Markdown code blocks or extra explanations. If there are multiple changes, focus on the core logic.
